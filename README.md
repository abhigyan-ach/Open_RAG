Here's a basic `README.md` file for your project that connects to the Terra API and builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to recommend food options based on wearable data.

# Wearable-Data-Food-Recommender

This project connects to the Terra API to retrieve real-time health data from wearables (e.g., activity, nutrition, sleep) and uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to generate personalized food recommendations based on the retrieved data.

## Features

- **Wearable Data Integration**: Retrieve data such as activity, calories burned, sleep quality, etc., from wearable devices using the Terra API.
- **RAG Model**: A retrieval-augmented generation system that combines wearable data and a GPT-based model to provide personalized food recommendations.
- **Food Knowledge Base**: A simple database of food options and their nutritional information, which can be expanded over time.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for API integration and data processing.
- **Terra API**: Retrieves real-time wearable data.
- **OpenAI GPT**: Generates personalized food recommendations based on wearable data.
- **Requests Library**: For handling API requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- A Terra API key. You can get it from [Terra](https://docs.tryterra.co/) by creating an account and setting up a project.
- An OpenAI API key. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) to obtain the API key.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wearable-data-food-recommender.git
   cd wearable-data-food-recommender
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Replace `your_terra_api_key_here` in the code with your Terra API key.
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key` in the code with your OpenAI API key.

### Setting Up Terra API

Follow these steps to get the `AUTH_TOKEN` for retrieving wearable data:
1. Create a Terra account and register your application.
2. Follow the OAuth process in Terra to get user authentication and authorization.
3. Once authenticated, the user will receive an `AUTH_TOKEN`, which will be used to pull real-time data from Terra.

### Example Usage

1. **Get Wearable Data**: Use the Terra API to pull wearable data such as activity, sleep, and nutrition.
2. **Generate Food Recommendations**: Use the retrieved wearable data as input to the GPT model, which will recommend food options based on calories burned, sleep quality, and more.

Here's a quick example of how to use the code:

```python
# Retrieve activity data
activity_data = get_wearable_data('activity', AUTH_TOKEN)

# Generate a personalized food recommendation
food_recommendation = generate_food_recommendation(activity_data)
print(food_recommendation)
```

## Project Structure

## Expanding the Project

This project can be expanded in various ways:
1. **Food Database**: Expand the list of food options and nutritional information.
2. **More Metrics**: Incorporate more wearable data, such as hydration, heart rate, and stress levels, to further refine recommendations.
3. **Model Tuning**: Fine-tune the GPT model or switch to a custom-trained model for better personalization.
